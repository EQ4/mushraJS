It is described in detail \r\nin the [ITU-R recommendation BS.1534-1](http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.1116-1-199710-I/e).\r\n\r\nThe framework does not rely on any server side ressources and is capable to completely run locally in \r\nyour browser. However you could publish the configured test scripts on a web server to easily reach your participants or even transmit the results to a web service for collection and further evaluation.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://www.sebastiankraft.net/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nMushraJS has already been used for for real listening tests by the author and should work reliably. Anyway, please thoroughly test your setup before your public test starts.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAs the framework uses modern HTML5 techniques for audio playback and the user interface it \r\nis very important to use a modern web browser. The support for different audio file types varies a lot between the different browsers. I would recommend to use .WAV files as these are lossless and supported by all major browsers with the only exception of the Microsoft Internet Explorer. Other file formats like .FLAC, .MP3 or .OGG are only supported by different subsets of browsers.\r\n\r\nJQuery and JQueryUI are used to simplify the coding with JavaScript. Both are already part of \r\nthe package and can be found in `js/` subfolder.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the test is written in [JSON format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). \r\nSee `example_config.js` to get an impression on how it works, it should be pretty self explanatory. The config is loaded before any other JavaScript files in the header of the `index.html` file.\r\n\r\nSome of the texts, for example the introduction on the first page, can be edited in the `index.html` file. The corresponding `<div>` tags are marked by comments.\r\n\r\n\r\nServer side data evaluation\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIt is possible to send the results to a server script and to collect and evaluate them in a central place. See `results.php` for a basic example. This saves the transmitted results in a human readable .TXT file with the timestamp in its name. This is not intendend to run out of the box and needs some PHP and JS skills to get it up and running. There are plans for a more comfortable server backend but currently no time is available to work on this.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nsebastian_kraft (AT) gmx (DOT) de\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe complete sources, html and script files as well as images are released unter the *GPLv3 \r\nlicense*.
